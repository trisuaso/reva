Reva implements a template rendering engine based on [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/).
It generates Rust code from your templates at compile time
based on a user-defined `struct` to hold the template's context.
See below for an example, or read [the book][docs].

**"Pretty exciting. I would love to use this already."** --
[Armin Ronacher][mitsuhiko], creator of Jinja

All feedback welcome. Feel free to file bugs, requests for documentation and
